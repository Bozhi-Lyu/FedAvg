# Uncertainty Estimation and Calibration Measurement in Federated Learning

We simulated different data distribution scenarios and then implemented FedAvg algorithm from scratch. We used entropy and VR as indicators of uncertainty, and ECE score to
measure calibratioN. Then we explored the affect of different model parameters in FL architecture on accuracy, uncertainty and calibration quality
